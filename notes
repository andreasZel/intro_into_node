# Node has a non-blocking I/O

 it can run things concurrently using event loop. A regisry for
 work that handles requests and calls a function that tells us
 it's done.
 
# Node RELP (Read-Eval-Print_loop)

 basicaly a console like in browser, you can acess it typing node
 
# Process and Environment

 Node runs in operating system unlike javasript. So it contains process object.
 
 1. process
 
    contains argv, it contains the parameters when a node file is run
    argv[0] is the instance of Node
	argv[1] is the file
	argv[2-n] are the parameters 
	
	so node index.js 1, 2, 3
	
	has arg[2] == 1;
	
 2. env
  
    environment variables from the system. So you can inject variables
	if you want to be safe.
	
# start program
 
 run npm init --y
 
 this will add a package.json file to project
 
# init cli

 1. add a bin to package.json, that is a object containing the cli name 
 and the file that will be run
 
 "bin": {
    "note": "./index.js"
  }
  
  2. run npm link that creates a symlink from the the operating system
  to our js code. 
  
  3. add a hashbang that tells the file to entepreter the environment as javasript
     #!/usr/bin/env node
