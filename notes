# Node has a non-blocking I/O

 it can run things concurrently using event loop. A regisry for
 work that handles requests and calls a function that tells us
 it's done.
 
# Node RELP (Read-Eval-Print_loop)

 basicaly a console like in browser, you can acess it typing node
 
# Process and Environment

 Node runs in operating system unlike javasript. So it contains process object.
 
 1. process
 
    contains argv, it contains the parameters when a node file is run
    argv[0] is the instance of Node
	argv[1] is the file
	argv[2-n] are the parameters 
	
	so node index.js 1, 2, 3
	
	has arg[2] == 1;
	
 2. env
  
    environment variables from the system. So you can inject variables
	if you want to be safe.
